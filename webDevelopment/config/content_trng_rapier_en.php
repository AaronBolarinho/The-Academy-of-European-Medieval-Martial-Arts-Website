There are two major forms of medievally documented bucklers. The first is a simple round shield with the fist positioned directly behind the boss with a variety of shapes of face and depths of rim, similar to the bucklers illustrated in I.33. The second major form is a corrugated rectangle as suggested by Achille Marozzo in his Opera Nova. <sup><a href=\"#1\" title=\"Reference #1: Opera Nova\">[1]</a></sup>";

The source of the material used for training sword & buckler at AEMMA is the MS I.33 treatise or Tower Fechtbuch. <sup><a href=\"#2\" title=\"Reference #2: MS I.33\">[2]</a></sup> This remarkable manuscript, simply entitled 'I.33' is comprised of 32 pages consisting of over a hundred ink-and-watercolour drawings, accompanied with Latin text describing the technique of sword & buckler combat. The original author is unknown to this day and the date of the manuscript is still in question, however, it has been dated to the late 13th century, and identified its owner as the secretary of Bishop of Würzburg. Much of the material studied can be sourced either in its original format in the AEMMA online library, or an excellent publication by Dr. Jeffrey Forgeng entitled \"The Medieval Art of Swordsmanship - A Facsimile & Translation of Europe's Oldest Personal Combat Treatise, Royal Armouries MS.I.33\", published by Chivalry Bookshelf, 2003. <sup><a href=\"#3\" title=\"Reference #3: Forgeng\">[3]</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#4\" title=\"Reference #4: limited edition\">[4]</a></sup>";

$trng_1_p3[0]	= "The rationale for using the I.33 as the principle source for sword & buckler, is that it is the earliest known treatise on this fighting style, the commentaries offer enough contextual and conceptual detail to reconstruct this particular fighting style, and the illustrations offer visual information on the manner of execution of the guards and plays. The sword & buckler, although not explicity mentioned in Fiore's treatise, does create the opportunity for schollers to train in a fighting style which provides an excellent base for longsword training. Sword & buckler also emphasizes the physical mechanics of working with both hands together, and separately depending upon the situation. This is an important element in longsword training, that despite the sword being gripped by both hands, there are numerous situations in which one hand would leave the longsword grip, and engage with the opponent in giocco stretto plays. Sword & buckler also offers the schollers a relatively good defense for the hands in particular during real-time free-play bouts.";
