  <p>The list of medieval prices which follows is by no means complete or thoroughly
  researched; I merely extracted references from some of the books I have, and I thought
  others might like to inspect it. The sources I used are listed at the end. If an item is
  listed several times, it is because I had several references I wished to record. </p>

  <pre>Money goes as follows:</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="font-size:14px;">
  <pre> 1 pound (L) = 20 shillings (s)
 1 crown = 5 shillings
 1 shilling = 12 pence (d)
 1 penny = 4 farthings
 1 mark = 13s 4d
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The French <em>livre</em>, <em>sou</em>, and <em>denier</em> are equivalent to the
  pound, shilling and penny (Latin <em>liber</em>, <em>solidus</em>, and <em>denarius</em>,
  &nbsp; which is where the English abbreviations &quot;L.s.d&quot; come from). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For ease, I've divided this list into the following sections: <ul>
    <li><a href="#TOOLS">Tools</a></li>
    <li><a href="#HORSES">Horses</a></li>
    <li><a href="#FOOD AND LIVESTOCK">Food and livestock</a></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course, a price list is a misleading guide to a medieval economy, because so many
  goods were either produced within a household, or supplied by a lord. Retainers could get
  money, but they would also get food, lodging, weapons (sometimes), and cloth. Knights
  Templar were provided with clothes, horses, and armor. </p>

  <p>* Source says 2s/day.&nbsp; This is not only insanely high, but the text also claims
  that the board was the same as at Oxford--i.e., 2s/week or 104s/year.</p>
  <p>** A <em>pecia</em> is 16 columns of 62 lines of 32 letters, i.e., 31 744 letters, or
  about 7 500 - 8 000 words.&nbsp; Rental period is not specified, but I would guess a year;
  books were rented to be copied, and copying the Bible took 15 months.&nbsp; See [9], p.

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: mail is chain mail; almost all the rest is plate-armor. The armor of the knight
  in 1374 was probably mail with some plates; same for Gloucester's. Mail was extremely
  susceptible to rust, and was cleaned by rolling it in sand and vinegar in a barrel.
  Pauldrons are shoulder plates; morions are open helms, burgonets and bascinets closed
  helms; and a target refers to any of a number different kind of shields. Armor of proof is
  tested during the making with blows or shots from the strongest weapons of the time; if a
  weapon is listed, the armor does not claim to be proof against everything, only that it is
  proof up to that weapon's strength (eg pistol proof is not musket proof, but may be sword
  proof). All plate armor was lined with cloth, to pad the wearer, quiet the armor, and
  reduce wear between the pieces. This, along with the necessary straps, was a significant
  amount of the expense. An armorer asking for money to set up shop in 1624 estimated
  production costs and profit for a number of different types of armor: I give two examples
  below ([5], pp. 189-190). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: It was mandatory in England for all freemen to own certain types of weapons and
  armor. (In 1181, every freeman having goods worth 10 marks (1 mark = 13s 4d) had to have a
  mail shirt, a helmet, and a spear. All other freemen should have helmet, spear, and
  gambeson (quilted armor) [4], p. 39.) Later, the government stored arms and armour in
  churches for use; in the 13th century anyone with an income of L2-L5 (wealthy peasants)
  had to have bows; archery practice became compulsory on Sundays and holidays. You may know
  that the extreme range of the longbow was 400 yards, but did you know that a statute of
  Henry VIII no one over 24 could practice at a range of less than 220 yards? (See [4], p.
  95 and elsewhere). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: for guessing prices, see the section on tools (an axe for 5d). An armorer might
  make 24s a month; say a week to make a decent sword, and you might get a price that way.
  See the section on books and education for fencing instruction.</p>
