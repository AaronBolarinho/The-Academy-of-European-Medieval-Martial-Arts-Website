<b>Dear Fellow medieval enthusists I saw a bit on TV Ontario last week about your organization. It was extremely exciting and interesting. It was good to see a group in Canada dedicated to the study of authentic western warrior arts. I have always been interested in studying the real thing. Alot of the so called historical reinactment groups have not really satisfied my desire to learn and practice the real thing. Throught surfing the net I have found similar groups to yours, but they have always been quite far away or overseas. I am glad to find a group just a few hours down the 401, depending on my speed.  I am interested to know if you know of anyone in the Windsor/Detroit area, or in Ann Arbor or Lansing, Mich who is part of your group; or non-affliated people who I could meet and practise with. Or are there any canadian groups near to Windsor. Also when and where does your, Toronto group meet. You have a very interesting and easy to surf site. The list of recommended sutlers is an invaluable resourse.Keep up the good work and a merry christmas to you and yours.

<b>                            Hey Everyone! I'm a member of the San Diego Chapter, started by David Holloway. I am looking for a list of Aemma chapters/groups that are retained inside California. It is always great to have people to fight with but I think it would be even greater if the group members could stay in contact with each other and organize events. I know that training is great fun and hard work in itself but I strongly belive that if you train with more than 10 people it becomes a better learning experience, allowing you to see and defeat your flaws and share information with others around you. As for the advertising of the Aemma I belive it could be better if we could organize a public campaign. Placing flyers and posters inside "Interest Spots" such as libraries, knife & sword shops, and college campuses. The Aemma is a great thing. I just wished it had existed before the SCA and the Adrian empire, because now I fear that I have honed my skills to a degree to which is false, and which I previously thought as "Medieval Combat" I just hope that we can save interested people from dealing with the manipulation and half shallowness of Recreation and Reenactment groups.  Thankyou -Adam</b><br />

<b>The Medieval martial arts is like and Equal to any other in many ways. Knightly ways from those bygone eras are not lost, but reclaimed and have influenced many forms of combat from ancient time to ficticious realms. From eras forgotten, to 'a long time ago in a galaxy far far away... I am immensely overjoyed that such a new form of combat training has been brought to the surface. Its evolution and continued growth is a carrer that I shall be very happy to join. Even on my bent as a self styled Jedi, there is always more to learn, always more to see, always more to grow on.

<b>Hello everyone  As I hadn't been checking the guest book often, I only recently came across a few posts where females expressed interest in AEMMA along with questions/concerns about their ability to participate.  I've been with AEMMA only a short time, and have been handling swords for only a year or so beyond that.  Nevertheless, I am quite confident in saying that there is no reason a woman cannot participate or hold her own in this field.  If I may, I'd like to assuage any fears by saying that, as in any physical endeavor, you get out of it as much as you put into it.  The more you train and generally immerse yourself in fencing, the better you will be.    As well, I truly believe what one may lack in physical strength one can compensate for with agility, speed, experience and mental state (this goes for both males and females).  I heard this many times over the past weekend at the WMA Workshops as well.  You should also know that the instructors are thorough, attentive and very patient with everyone, regardless of gender or age.  Hope this helps...and feel free to email with any further questions you may have.  Angie Stathakos (AEMMA)  </b><br />

<b>I came to this site through a link from the CKF (Canadian Kendo Federation). AEMMA is both impressive and disappointing. The impressive part is the scholarly effort put into research. Very impressive indeed, and a very good web presentation.  However, despite the extremely good research effort, AEMMA is still a disappointment. Reviving moribund European martial arts is a nice idea, but doesn't look like it would work well in practice. From a kendo(kenjutsu) perspective, the technique in the sample photos looks clumsy and the use of steel weapons for competition is ridiculously dangerous. No kendoka in their right mind would consider attempting to replicate ancient training techniques and equipment. Modern kendo is the result of decades of development and refinement, while most European sword techniques were abandoned centuries ago. Instead of trying to revive these techniques, perhaps your efforts would be better directed towards developing a modern martial art based on these techniques, in the same way kendo developed from kenjutsu). Good luck with your efforts though: Rob Wood        </b><br />

<b>I have always felt that my principles and values belonged to another time... which is one reason I took up martial arts. Not only as a way to get into shape but also to associate with people who were of a different mind set. Yet even then, I felt that the eastern philosophy didn't really do it for me. Which was why I was very interested to read the article in the Star. It is good to see that values like honour and chivalry still spark an interst in some.  </b><br />

<b>Hi all...i have been fond of the art of boffer combat since the days i laid eyes upon 30 adult men charge into each other and go at it with padded swords, pole arms, shields, and various other weapons.  I first saw it at an Arcon in Kansis City and when i come to MO for a few weeks each year, i fight in their group...the the big problem is i live in RI and i have been unable to find anyone in my area who also does the boffer combat.  I make my own weapons, and most people in my neighborhood get into it (when i have the weapons available) But i want to meet a real group...If you are out there and you read this, then please e-mail me (Puck02911@yahoo.com) or anyone who has any info please e-mail me so that i may fight the good fight!</b><br />
