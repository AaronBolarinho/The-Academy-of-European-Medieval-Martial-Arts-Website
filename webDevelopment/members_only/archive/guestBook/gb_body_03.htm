<b>Great site!  One of my past times has been researching various Martial Arts of the World and then combining it with my own formal training and cut away at it until I have a very practical Combat fighting system. My own brand of Jeet Kune Do.
I think ALL Martial Art system have value.  To those who disagree such as traditional Eastern Martial Artist or modern day Hybrid systems just take a look at the some of the techniques.  Many are the same as done in the Eastern Martial Arts.
Oh, by the way, to the Brazilian Jiujitsu guy who bashed your system.  I have studied BJJ, Judo and Jujitsu along with Muay Thai, Kuntao Silat and Kenpo.  
Take a look at the knife defense in the Italian online treatise, yes that is the same outside armbar disarm as demostrated in Hoyce Gracie's Brazilian Jiujitsu Street Defense.  Enough said.

<b>G'day Gents,
Great site to visit, so-much-so that I have bookmarked it and will be a regular vistor from now on.  I have been studying Karate and Kenjutsu for the past several years, and I must admit it is refreshing to see that a group of dedicated people working to bring back and maintain the European martial arts.  I have studied European and American knife fighting techniques, albeit briefly, and think that that there would be much benefit in students of Japanese Arts cross-training in the European Martial Arts.  I suspect that we would be surprised just how similar alot of the techniques are.
Anyway, strongest regards to you and yours, and keep up the high standards.
PS, I agree with the comments about things being very slow to load, for future reference.</b><br />

<b>Site's slow in loading & difficult for my system to read.  Not had time yet to try to read through what I can but so far just skimming through, can't "quickly" find anything to do with training, mentioned in some of the posts here.  I'm obsessed about staff & stick martial arts of any & all forms.  I wish there were actual videos of such training of European martial arts, including single-stick, quarter-staff, etc.  I've done martial arts most of my life, esp okinawan Bojutsu.  There seems to be only one site on Quarter-staff, that green background one.  The rest seem just the same sketches of 2 guys in flat-top straw hats poking at eachother with walking-sticks but little else on technique.  Anyways, thanks for you time.</b><br />

<b>Are you guys for real? I mean after looking at your website I have come to the conclusion that you are just making a very humourous spoof of the martial arts and if so then i think what you have done is extremely funny and entertaining! Well done. But please for the love of God I hope that you guys dont take what you do seriously as if it works, because it wont. Havent you guys ever heard of brazilian jiu jitsu? If not I suggest you look into it and take it up if you are really serious about fighting, it is the only thing that works for "REAL". Please stop kidding yourselfs before you guys get into a real fight with a real tough guy and get seriously hurt or worse, you are fooling only the fools, I applaud your sense of humour and pity your lack of common sense. Please for your own sake, stop trying to justify this kind of pitiful nonsense as an effective form of self defense, get smart, grow a brain and train brazilian jiu jitsu, how many times do the Gracies have to clown and humiliate pathetic fools like yourselves before you guys understand the reality of the martial arts: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu WORKS - Everything else (including your system) is USELESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats all for today kids....schools out.</b><br />
