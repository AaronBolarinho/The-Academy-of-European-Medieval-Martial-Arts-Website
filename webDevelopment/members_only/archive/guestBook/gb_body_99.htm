<b>Great site.  I've been a heavy fighter in the SCA for 15 years now and I think this is a great idea.  Have been interested in live steel fighting for some time, however, I am concerned about safety.  Would love to start such a group here.  Have a couple of interested friends, including my wife.

<b>Hi. It is great to see that so many people are interested in fencing - espeacally in medieval fencing! But there is one big problem in "redoing" the old "art of fencing". We all have to thank Gustav Hergsell for copying three of the six Talhoffer manuscripts. But: He was a great fencing master - no doubt - but he wasnt at the old german literature and language, so he made some mistakes which have  survived up to now. Perhaps I can help to clear one of them. (<i>Please see entry "Hergsell's translations of Talhoffer
clarifications" in warrior-to-warrior forum under "Documentation & Ancient Treatises" for full explaination.</i>) <br />Yours sincerly, Norbert Krines, student at the University Bamberg and "�ungsleiter" (some kind of trainer for the easy things) at the local fencing club.

<b>Hi,I would be very interested in finding a local class (affiliate) in sword techniquies.  I've been involved in a local LARP group for about 5 yearsand also have taken martial arts, as a kid, so I already have a small level of experience, using padded boffer weapons.  I'm seeking to increase my level of experties,physical conditioning and this seems to suit this well.  Also I have approx. 100 friends +/- who are interested  in the same sort of thing.  The LARP group,that I'm in, are medieval re-inactors (this is a continuing, monthly game) so its possible that I could get a number of pople interested in this.ThanksGary Freitas</b><br />

<b>This is an interesting idea.  It is a very good idea in fact.  Many people I know like this era of combat.  I used to play something called "melee".  It is midieval sword play using pvc pipe and pipe wrap.  It as close as you could come to your training that you offer.  It is nothing like what you have however.  Yours is an actual class.  Ours was nothing more than a game that we chose to play.  Your class more than likely teaches the fine points of combat and proper ettiquet.  Similar to Asian martial arts.

<b>Like those who have posted here before me, I wish to offer my unqualified good wishes to the AEMMA.  I am utterly ecstatic to see historical European combat styles being practiced with a scholarly rather than a sport or fantasy approach.  I find it a pity, however, that your professed stylistic cut-off date excludes 16-17th century rapier technique, despite the amount of information you have available on it.  I suppose that this omission spares me the expense of moving to Toronto, though, as otherwise the proverbial wild horses could not keep me away.</b><br />
