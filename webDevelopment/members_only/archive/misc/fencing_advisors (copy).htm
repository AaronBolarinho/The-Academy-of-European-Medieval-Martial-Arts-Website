<p><img src="../images/coatofarms/armorialBearings_CHA_180.jpg" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt="AEMMA's grant of an amorial bearings" title="AEMMA's grant of an amorial bearings" width="180" height="194" />The <b>Academy of European Medieval Martial Arts</b> or <b>AEMMA</b> (pronounced "<b>ehma</b>") is focused on the research, reconstruction and resurrection of authentic mediaeval combative systems (armed, unarmed, armoured and unarmoured), firmly based on the works of the late 14th century Friulian swordsmaster by the name of Fiore dei Liberi, demonstrating the deadly practicality and effectiveness of the art as it applies to today's personal self-defense.</p>
<p>AEMMA was initially created in May of 1998 in  <img src="../images/flags/caFlag.gif" height="10" alt="Canadian flag" /> <a href="http://www.toronto.com" target="_blank"><b>Toronto</b></a> <img src="../images/flags/caFlag.gif" height="10" alt="Canadian flag" /> and under the laws of Ontario's Corporations Act and the Regulations of the Ministry of the Attorney General, was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation (NPO Corporation Number: 1468524) in May 28, 2001. It has as its mission: </p>
<blockquote><font color="#461B7E">"The mission of AEMMA is to resurrect, research, study, practice and instruct in the combat skills, philosophies and principles of accomplished European Mediaeval martial artists and to achieve a state which would be consistent with that of a mediaeval combatant in both technology and ideal."</font></blockquote>
In order to satisfy the mission, AEMMA is dedicated to the research, study, reconstruction and practice of early period martial arts in all aspects with respect to arms and armour, technical skills, combative theory and the relevant philosophies and principles as they relate to these fighting arts.  In order to satisfy this mission, AEMMA has these goals: 
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>research and study historical sources in the form of treatises, manuscripts, illuminations, etc. as well as the physical examination of artifacts from the period including arms and armour accessed through the <a href="http://www.rom.on.ca" target="_blank">Royal Ontario Museum</a> (ROM) in order to facilitate accurate resurrecting and reconstructing the mediaeval fighting arts;<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>to provide a training and research environment to permit the application of research into practice and their later inclusion into the relevant training programs, and to enable the instruction and training of these fighting arts in order to develop the students' personal defensive and offensive skills.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>It is the desire and ambition of AEMMA to establish the world's leading academy in the research, training and instruction of mediaeval martial arts by creating a viable and sustainable environment in which to develop and evolve the mediaeval martial arts system known as <b><i>l&#180;arte dell&#180;armizare</i></b> [ <a href="#footnote1">1</a> ] or the 'fighting art'.  The intention is to offer to interested parties, an alternative training system to the popular martial arts systems available today by being able to provide all of the expected benefits of martial arts training in terms of self-defense, fitness and offensive skills while learning and training in <b><i>l&#180;arte dell&#180;armizare</i></b></p>
<p>In conjunction with this ambition, AEMMA will further its mission through education and programming designed to enhance the students' experience and appreciation of the fighting art through events such as armoured tournaments or <a href="../index2.php?pg=t6" target="_top"><i>pas d'armes</i></a>, <a href="../index2.php?pg=t7" target="_top">judicial duels/trial by combat</a>, <a href="../index2.php?pg=t8" target="_blank">unarmoured tournaments</a> and other aspects of the period including the study and application of heraldry.  These events are intended to not only educate the students of the Academy, but also to educate and enhance the experience of the public in these particular aspects of the mediaeval period.</p>
<h3>The Objectives</h3>
<p>To accomplish the mission of the Academy, the objectives of AEMMA will be to:</p>
<ol>
<li>develop, enhance and train the mediaeval martial artist in the areas of unarmoured and armoured combat utilizing the knightly weapons of sword, dagger, spear (lance) and poleaxe, and their variations including sword & shield and sword & buckler;</li>
<li>to provide a training environment for students which is conducive to building technical expertise in swordsmanship, un-armed fighting skills and other weapons-based fighting skills;</li>
<li>develop and deliver training and fighting programs, based on research on the early 15th century treatise entitled <i>Flos Duellatorum</i> and <i>Flos Battaglia</i> authored by swordsmaster <a href="../onlineResources/liberi/liberiHome.htm">Fiore dei Liberi</a>;</li>
<li>fostering good will and sportsmanship; and such other complementary purposes not inconsistent with the mission;</li>
<li>organize and coordinate sparring & fencing practices, training sessions, educational demonstrations and/or presentations, competitions and tournaments;</li>
<li>to identify and develop mutually beneficial relationships with both domestic and international arms & armourer developers and suppliers for safe to use, historically consistent equipment including armour, mail, weaponry, etc.;</li>
<li>to identify and develop professional relationships with both domestic and international traditional European martial arts schools, academies, museums and associations in order to enhance and further the research and development of mediaeval fighting arts into a credible, viable and sustainable martial arts style.</li>
</ol>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The AEMMA was the brain-child of its founder, <a href="bios/dcvet.htm">David M. Cvet</a> in late 1997 and early 1998. Having a number of years of Eastern martial arts training, and having a deep interest in the history of mediaeval Europe, came to realize that the market had a giant gap between the academic pursuits of mediaeval studies, and the re-enactment societies. Beginning with a few like-minded individuals, the research of the mediaeval treatises available was applied to the physical manifestation of the writings found in these mediaeval manuscripts into a living fighting arts system. These activities eventually evolved into a training system attracting more and more individuals interested in the pursuit of mediaeval martial arts training. At some point, it became clear that the work was no longer an informal collection of individuals, but a martial arts training school, and AEMMA was born.</p>

Joining AEMMA, he found a group of like-minded people who also were interested in the longbow's simplicity and challenge. Currently, Paul organizes and instructs the AEMMA archery group and the <a href="http://www.rom.on.ca" target="_blank">Royal Ontario Museum</a> Mediaeval Longbow course. He still takes great pleasure in experimenting with and building primitive and mediaeval archery tackle. Paul helped start two archery clubs in BC and also gave seminars showing camp instructors how to teach archery. By then, Paul was an experienced woodworker, yet he found making archery tackle still pleasantly challenging. <font color="#e6347e"><i>Click on the photo on the left to view complete biography.</i></font><br />&nbsp;</td>

<li><a name="footnote1"></a><b>l&#180;arte dell&#180;armizare</b> The name <a href="glossary.html#armizare"><i>l&#180;arte dell&#180;armizare</i></a> or simply <a href="glossary.html#armizare"><i>armizare</i></a> identifies this particular form of <a href="glossary.html#tma">Traditional European Martial Art</a> (TEMA), which is based on the tradition of <a href="../onlineResources/liberi/liberiHome.htm">Fiore dei Liberi</a>.  In at least five versions of the Liberi treatise, the versions studied at AEMMA are referred to as:
<ul>
<li>Getty: "armi&ccedil;are arte de combatter"</li>
<li>Morgan: "armizare e arte de combater"</li>
<li>Pisani-Dossi: "armi&ccedil;ar e de conbatere"</li>
</ul>
The term "<i>armizare</i>" is derived from the above examples, and is felt that it uniquely identifies this art.  Liberi in his texts would often refer to this as simply "the art".<br />&nbsp;</li>
