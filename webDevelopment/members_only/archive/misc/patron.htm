				<p>Robbie has an intense interest in heraldry and its history and application, in such historical events such as jousts, tournaments and <i>pas d'armes</i>. His interest in this area, led to discussions with David when AEMMA was organizing their first <i>pas d'armes</i> hosted by the <a href="http://www.rom.on.ca" target="_blank">Royal Ontario Museum</a> in 2008, to which he agreed to take part of the event as its Patron. Robbie donated the prize, a broadsword which he presented to the armoured combatant (the appellants) who was voted "first amongst equals", and presented the tournament medalion to each of the combatants at the conclusion of the event. He continues to donate prizes for the "first amongst equals", and presents the medalions at these events.</td>
