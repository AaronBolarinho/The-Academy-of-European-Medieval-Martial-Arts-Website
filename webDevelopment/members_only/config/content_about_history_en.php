$history_intro[0] = "The following is a detailed history on the origins and development of AEMMA. The history as conveyed in the \"public\" site is meant to be brief and oriented towards marketing. However, for those who wish to study the Academy's past, this is a good place to start.";

$sub_title_1[0] = "The Italian \"Seed\" in '97";
$history_p1[0] = "The story of AEMMA actually began in Janurary, 1997 in the beautiful city of Milan, Italy, where <a href=\"javascript:popup('../content/bios','dcvet.php',550,450)\" title=\"David M. Cvet\">David M. Cvet</a> was on an information technology contract consulting with the Italian bank, Banca Commerciale Italiano (BCI) located on Piazza della Scala. Having had an interest in all aspects of medieval history, it was during this time in Milan that his passion for the sword surfaced after one of the staff at BCI, knowing his interest, introduced David to a friend of his who was working on a manuscript he had inherited from his grandfather, who happened to be the swordsmaster for the Hungarian calvary and who instructed them on sabre fencing on horseback.  This fellow by the name of Ulysses Provolo ( SCA persona: <i>Victor Draconis</i> ) happened to be the \"sword master\" for the Shire Ranann, a part of the local <a href=\"http://www.sca.org\" target=\"_blank\">Society for Creative Anachronism or SCA</a> <sup><a href=\"#1\" title=\"Reference #1: SCA\">[1]</a></sup> in Milan. The manuscript in his possession happened to be a poor quality photocopy of Fiore dei Liberi's \"<i>Flos Duellatorum</i>\". Ulysses was intent on resurrecting the lost art, and was happy and pleased that David shared his interest.  They decided to work together for many months while I was on contract at BCI. Ulysses and his lovely wife, Sylvie, who worked with us, had arranged a variety of training locations in Milan which included a school gym, park and apartment outdoor parking area. He had also formed a casual organization by the name of <i>Scuola di Spada Basso Medioveale Corazzata</i> in Milan. His swords were...\"sword like objects\" being quite heavy and unruly. They were blunted steel and were fashioned more like claymores, each sword weighing in at least 3 to 3.5 Kg! They worked through the sword plays illustrated with captions in the Fiore's treatise, never actually working through the other sections of the treatise as the interest was primarily on swordplay. Obviously, his Italian background allowed for some abilities to translate the verses found in the manuscript, and through trial-and-error, detailed each play physically. The pair worked through Fiore's treatise once or twice weekly whenever David was working in Milan. However, this initial research into what was then referred to \"live steel\" training, came to a conclusion when the contract with BCI concluded in December 1997. Throughout the year while working in Milan, David had searched for a similar activity in Toronto, but was dismayed that there was nothing like this in Toronto. The only thing that came somewhat close to this form of swordplay was the SCA and therefore, contemplated joining the SCA or starting something on his own.";

$caption_image_2[0] = "The first rendition of AEMMA's coat of arms, illustrated by David on August 5, 1998. The 'tribal design' on the lower portion of the arms (shield) represents a warrior and which happens to be the same as the tattoo on David's upper right arm.";
$history_p2[0] = "Being back in Toronto full time, David found himself attached to a local SCA group in the north-end of Toronto known as \"<a href=\"http://www.ealdormere.ca/skeldergate.html\" title=\"Canton of Skeldergate\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Canton of Skeldergate</i></a>\", which is part of the \"<a href=\"http://www.ealdormere.ca\" title=\"Kingdom of Eoldormere\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Kingdom of Eoldormere</i></a>\", an organizational unit of the SCA covering most of Ontario.  This was the only game in town at that time.  During the months of April to September with the SCA, he was engaged heavily with armoured \"combat\" every Wednesday evening with the fellows of Skeldergate with the likes of Paul Czudnochowsky ( <i>Berus Wolfsonne</i> ), Brett Nelson ( <i>Njall Iskaldur</i> ) and Craig Cox ( <i>Thorbjorn Osis Brandsson</i> ). It was during that time that David learned much about crafting, constructing armour out of heated and moulded plastics sourced from large black plastic drums (to the annoyance of David's wife, Gail for using their oven to pre-heat the plastics in order to shape the components appropriately for the construction of \"armour\"), David became somewhat disenchanted during the summer with the style of fighting as he realized it was too distant from the research conducted in Milan and was disatisfied playing with rattan sword-like-objects. He wanted to find a closer interpretation to the original techniques found in Fiore's manuscript and decided to pursue assembling a study group focused on the research and reconstruction of \"live-steel\" swordplay. Sometime during July of 1998, David found a few like-minded individuals who shared his interest in pursuing live-steel swordplay. These individuals were members of the SCA and were in various stages of engagement/disenchantment with the SCA at that time. They included Steven Perpich, his wife Michele Witt and the third, Kevin Lewis ( <i>Edward the Chaste</i> ).  Steven had kindly offered his studio as a location to work through the plays. Concurrently during this study group, David was also formulating an organizational structure of the future \"thing\" and peppered the initial startup members with numerous correspondence (emails) with discussions on organizational structure, marketing, identify a treasurer, establish associates/affiliations, composing a training guide, sourcing training swords, sourcing/building mail shirts, define a mission statement, membership fees, designing a coat of arms, defining what this \"thing\" was to become, and setting up a domain name and website." ;

$caption_image_3[0] = "The final design for training swords (constructed from spring steel, provided by David to Roman) submitted to Roman Nasadiuk, August 20, 1998";

$history_p3[0] = "There was much happening during the remaining portion of 1998.  David lost his interest with the SCA, and focused his energy on developing the concept further and placing some structure around this \"thing\". A potential source of steel swords was identified from a fellow living in the west end of Toronto by the name of Roman Nasadiuk, who may be tasked to construct up to 2 dozen swords (no hilt or pommel, just blades with long tangs). Steven/Kevin were tasked with obtaining the \"furniture\" to fit onto the blades. These blades were constructed from spring-steel. During August of 1998, the first version of the mission statement was composed, clearly influenced by David's interaction with the SCA and of the Knights Templars from Steven and Kevin. It read \"<i>The mission of the 'Order' is to resurrect the philosophies, principles and skill of an accomplished European Medieval martial artist of noble character and to achieve a state of which would be consistent with that of the 15th century in both technology and ideal.</i>\"  Names of the \"thing\" tossed around at that time included: \"League of Medieval Warriors\", \"Order of European Medeival Combat\", \"Order of Medieval Martial Artists\".  Both the name of the \"thing\" and mission were adopted by the founding members on August 12, 1998, as the \"Academy of European Medieval Martial Arts\" and the mission statement which read: \"<i>The mission of the Academy is to resurrect the combat skills, philosophies, principles of an accomplished European Medieval martial artist and to achieve a state of which would be consistent with that of a 12th century warrior in both technology and ideal.</i>\".  Interestingly, the ranks defined at that time were <i>orbis pimitus</i> (first), <i>orbis secundus</i> (second), <i>orbis tertius</i> (third), <i>orbis quartus</i> (fourth). These ideas were then documented in AEMMA's first formal document authored by David entitled \"<i>The Academy of European Medieval Martial Arts - Concept, Scope and Structure</i>\".<a href=\"#2\" title=\"reference: AEMMA concept document\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>  The founding members also became aware of other organizations which were pursuing a similar tack, in particular, the Historical Armed Combat Association or HACA.  The domain names contemplated at this time were \"www.aemma.org\" and \"www.livesteel.org\", and the first sword design and quote materialized around this time as well. The final domain name selected was \"www.aemma.org\" and was created and registered on August 25, 1998. A new version of the concepts document was composed and expanded in areas to capture the thinking of what AEMMA was to become.<a href=\"#3\" title=\"reference: AEMMA concept & planning document\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>  Although David was still frequently visiting Milan during 1998 for further consultation and followups with BCI, being on the flights, allowed him to compose numerous planning and concept documents, peppering the initial founding members with much to review and to provide input.  The AEMMA's first training document entitled \"Training Forms\" <a href=\"#4\" title=\"reference: AEMMA training forms\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> was the first of many composed during the coming months.  Further work was done with respect to the constructing of steel training swords.  A request went out to Bill Fedun for a quote for assembly of the sword and hilt components.  The metal for the swords were ultimately sourced from Toronto Spring, a shop which specialized in automobile suspension parts.  The hilt assembly proved a challenge, as no one appeared to have the skills nor the equipment to build the hilt components. While these activities were progressing, David was continuing with email correspondence with Ulysses in Milan, for explanations and translations of the illustrations and text in Fiore's <i>Flost Duellatorum</i>.  In November of this year, AEMMA's first website made its debut on the internet which depicts a mission statement which is nearing the current mission statement of AEMMA, and the coat of arms are approaching the final design now blazoned for AEMMA which was granted by the Canadian Heraldic Authority. The beginnings of an online library also began with the implementation of the website. Medieval manuscripts sources were obtained from museums and libraries in Europe, along with their permission to digitize the files and display on the AEMMA website. An image of its first home page is depicted on the right.";

$caption_image_4[0] = "AEMMA's first home page depicting the nearly final version of its mission, along with a rendition of the Academy's arms which is approaching the arms final design currently adopted by AEMMA.

$history_p4[0] = "November of 1998 was a significant turning point for the fledgling Academy.  The initial founders became over-whelmed with the demands place on them by David, and the high level of expectations by David were often not met, resulting in arguments and conflict.  Steven and Michele were the first to pull out the stakes claiming that they cannot afford the commitment to startup an Academy. Kevin continued his involvement with the startup.  David had already established correspondence and information exchange with other individuals in North America and Europe, including Joerg Bellinghausen, Germany (source of Talhoffer's manuscript), Mark Rector, <a href=\"http://www.chicagoswordplayguild.com\" title=\"Chicago Swordplay Guild\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago Swordplay Guild</a> (Chicago), William Wilson, <a href=\"http://www.tattershall.org\" title=\"Tattershall School of Defence\" target=\"_blank\">Tattershall School of Defence</a> (USA), Giovanni Rapisardi, <a href=\"http://www.lacompagniadellaspada.it\" title=\"La Compagnia della Spada\" target=\"_blank\">La Compagnia della Spada</a> (Italy), Steve Hick, research (USA) and John Clements, <a href=\"http://www.thearma.org\" title=\"Historical Armed Combat Association\" target=\"_blank\">Historical Armed Combat Association</a>, HACA (USA) and Joe Cadieux, Tournament Productions (USA). David's co-worker and direct report, Michael Rasmusson also shared an interest in swords, in particular, German swordsmanship, which created some influence to turn David's attention from Fiore to Talhoffer. Desperate to search for \"replacements\" for Steven and Michele, he discovered <a href=\"javascript:popup('../content/bios','krekuta.php',550,450)\" title=\"Kel Rekuta\" >Kel Rekuta</a>, who had his shop, \"Capital Findings\" on King Street, Toronto, and who also withstood the brunt of David's desire to find like-minded individuals for this \"project\". David left pamphlets which promoted the study group, their longsword combat training with blunted steel weapons, and who cheerfully took the \"pressure\" imposed on him by David over this project. Kel would often capitulate with David's un-relenting demands and accept flyers, and indicated that he'd talk to some people who may be interested.  Anything to get rid of David from his shop! In mid-December of 1998, David received an introductory email from <a href=\"javascript:popup('../content/bios','bmcilmoyle.php',550,450)\" title=\"Brian A. McIlmoyle\">Brian A. McIlmoyle</a>, who revealed in his letter that he'd been following the development of AEMMA and expressed interest in David's plans and ideas. He offered his expertise and assistance in the project.  A lunch time meeting was scheduled for January 8, 1999 at the Hot House Cafe on the corner of King and Jarvis, Toronto. At that time, AEMMA had two individuals, David and Kevin only.";

$sub_title_3[0] = "Version 2.0, 1999";
$history_p5[0] = "The lunch with Brian was another significant milestone in the development of AEMMA.  David conveyed his ideas and plans, spoke nearly non-stop for nearly an hour, and Brian was sitting there quietly, listening intently, rarely saying a word. At the end of the monologue, there was what felt like a \"pregnant pause\".  Was Brian thinking that David was a whacko or crazy man, or that what David was doing was completely absurd, or that he was wondering how did he end up in this place having lunch with this nutbar?  After a few moments, Brian simply responded with \"I'm in\". Brian with his over 15 years fighting in the SCA, and his military background provided additional expertise and energy into the project. That was the beginning of a long time relationship between David and Brian, both dealing with the challenges, growth, stabilization of AEMMA in the coming years.";

The gym was perfect for training, and the centre had a park behind it allow all to train outdoors during the spring/summer/fall days. Although, there were additional study/research days with both David and Brian, which were conducted in the under-ground parking at David's condo on Frederick St., Toronto.  One memorable anecdote, Brian had been over frequently enough that he left his kit bag in the condo, which one day, one of Gail's cats promptly turned the open kit bag into a its own personal litter box. Brian came to the condo to work with David on refining some techniques, and he and David proceeded to put on the training gear. Brian's equipment wreaked so badly, there was talk of not working out and cleaning his gear instead, however, the decision was to proceed to the parking garage and work on their techniques. Unfortunately, the wreak was so extremely distracting, causing both to laugh hillariously, that the workout was cancelled and Brian took his gear home to air out and clean!";

$history_p7[0] = "1999 was a year of rapid growth and development in the area of historical martial arts, not only for AEMMA, but for many other historical martial arts schools in the world. The Academy now had a number of interested parties, including Mike Rasmusson, Kevin Lewis, Kevin Jarbeau and Robert Gissing. David's brother <a href=\"javascript:popup('../content/bios','ajcvet.php',550,450)\" title=\"Anton J. Cvet\">Anton J. Cvet</a> was doing some activities in Ottawa and was working with <a href=\"javascript:popup('../content/bios','dbmurphy.php',550,450)\" title=\"David B. Murphy\">David B. Murphy</a> around that time as well. Most, if not all organizations were attempting to position themselves as the leader in the field. Information exchange was rampant between the startup schools across the planet. There was high energy and excitment in this field and everyone was contributing to the general knowledgebase of the various arts, English, Italian and German. During this time of research and reconstruction, AEMMA had met a fellow by the name of Leon Samedi, who was extremely helpful in providing a perspective that the founding members may have missed.  The thought was that some of the \"frog DNA\" came from such people as Leon due to his great expertise in Asian fighting systems and his perspective. Strategic relationships were being forged that year with individuals such as Stephen Hand, <a href=\"http://stoccata.org\" title=\"Stoccata School of Defence\" target=\"_blank\">Stoccata School of Defence</a> in Australia, Milo Thurston, <a href=\"http://www.sirwilliamhope.org\" title=\"Linacre School of Defence\" target=\"_blank\">Linacre School of Defence</a> in the UK, Paul Macdonald, <a href=\"http://www.macdonaldarms.com\" title=\"Macdonald Academy of Arms\" target=\"_blank\">Macdonald Academy of Arms</a>, Edinburgh, Ramon Martinez & Jeanette Acosta-Martinez, <a href=\"http://www.martinez-destreza.com\" title=\"Martinez Academy of Arms\" target=\"_blank\">Martinez Academy of Arms</a>, New York, Terry Brown, <a href=\"http://www.terrybrownenglishmartialarts.com\" title=\"Terry Brown School of English Martial Arts\" target=\"_blank\">Terry Brown School of English Martial Arts</a>, UK and Andrea Lupo Sinclair, <a href=\"http://www.scherma-tradizionale.com title=\"The Andrea Lupo Sinclair Academy of Martial Arts\" target=\"_blank\">The Andrea Lupo Sinclair Academy of Martial Arts</a>, Italy. Other connections included notable individuals for sources of arms and armour such as <a href=\"http://www.christianfletcher.com\" title=\"Christian Fletcher\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Fletcher</a>, Robert Valentine (<a href=\"http://www.varmouries.com\" title=\"Valentine Armories\" target=\"_blank\">Valentine Armories</a>) and Peter Fuller, <a href=\"http://www.medievalrepro.com\" title=\"Medieval Reproductions\" target=\"_blank\">Medieval Reproductions</a>, Calgary, AB to name a few. David represented AEMMA at its first foray into the international scene by attending the Classical Fencing and Historical Swordsmanship Exposition, hosted by the Martinez Academy of Arms in January, 1999 in Jersey City. It was there that David finally met in person Maestros Ramon Martinez, Jeanette Acosta-Martinez, Paul Macdonald and Andrea Lupo Sinclair. David also attended the first Western Martial Arts Workshop hosted by the Chicago Swordplay Guild in Chicago, mid-October 1999. By virtue of David being there, it became the first \"international\" WMA workshop.  It was at that workshop that a discussion materialized, which included Greg Mele, John Kovacs, Pete Kautz and Dwight McLemore, of hosting such an event on an annual basis, and where AEMMA would host the event in the fall of 2000. It was all agreed to that AEMMA would host the next WMAW in Toronto. As the year was nearing the end, there were many discussions on the rules of armoured combat for the tournament to be included in the 2000 WMA, as well as promoting the event to many historical martial arts practitioners. Planning and testing the waters for interest for the next workshop was already underway before the year end. The most important aspect of the planned 2000 event was that John Clements (HACA) had agreed to deliver a number of classes at the workshop.  This proved to be greatly beneficial for the planning as he was considered \"excellent head table bait\". During the course of the year, David was also working on a monumental project of composing a training guide entitled \"<i>The Art of Longsword Combat</i>\" which in this draft, included a variety of exercises designed to prepare the practitioner working with the longsword. <a href=\"#6\" title=\"reference: Art of Longsword Combat\"><sup>[6]</sup></a>  Along with the work on the draft, the Academy was accumulating an ever expanding digital library of treatises, which were housed by the AEMMA website's online library.  These resources were sourced directly from libraries and museums, often received in microfilm format, and later digitized by AEMMA, and returning to the source, a digital copy of their microfilm. ";

$history_p8[0] = "AEMMA's biggest and most important event for the year was the 2nd Annual International Western Martial Arts Workshop, hosted at the Toronto Exhibition in the building operated by Medieval Times Restaurant Toronto, October 13-15. There were 130 attendees at this workshop, some coming from the UK, Scotland, Italy, Belgium, Spain and USA. The event attracted local media including the CBC. There were both an unarmoured (rapier) tournament and armoured tournament.  Brian, et al, spent an inordinate amount of time working on the rules and regulations to govern the armoured tournament. It was considered one of the most successful events in AEMMA's history. A comprehensive review and summary report entitled \"<i>Summary Report - 2nd Annual International Western Martial Arts Workshop</i>\" covers many exciting details of the event. <a href=\"#7\" title=\"reference: WMA 2000 Summary Report\"><sup>[7]</sup></a>  What wasn't widely known, were the events which occured leading up to this event which may have been disasterous in most cases, but worked in AEMMA's favour.";

$history_p9[0] = "The financing of this event was possible through a combination of AEMMA funds and funds contributed from David.  The risk assumed by David was in the neighbourhood of $15,000. It was undoubtedly, a stress point for David as he organized the event, all the while, hoping to recoup the funds and land in the black after all was said and done. The Exhibition place required a significant deposit in order to hold the venue for the October's event.  Having John Clements as the main head table bait required quite a bit of stroking on the part of David to ensure that the event will execute without a hitch.  During the last weekend of May, David had attended for only a day at the Swordplay Symposium International (SSI) <a href=\"#8\" title=\"reference: SSI\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> conference hosted in Houston by the HACA group, May 27-29, 2000 (David was on a tech gig in Houston and made the side trip to check out the SSI event). During this conference, there were presentations and lectures by the likes of Maestros Ramon Martinez, Jeanette Acosta-Martinez, Paul Macdonald and Lupo Sinclair. Other SSI advisors present included Stephen Hand, Brian Price, Hank Reinhardt (who conveyed his opinions that researching the medieval manuscripts was a waste of time, who has broken more swords than any other individual through all time, and who apparently slept with a firearm under his pillow! deceased: Oct 30, 2007), Jared Kirby, Steve Hick and Greg Mele. There were also casual rapier bouts and a few spontaneous bouts whereby the combatants were using SCA type of padded weapons. There was much buzz happening in Houston with respect to a meeting between David and John, as they had never met personally, and the members of HACA were anticipating a great partnership, given John's role in the upcoming WMAW in October.  David had a number of conversations with members of HACA, and found everyone to be pleasant and receptive, despite there being cultural and philosophical differences between AEMMA's approach to training and research and HACA's. Over the course of that day, David met John only once briefly, and John never spoke to David at all for the rest of the day. This became a concern to David, as he was thinking that perhaps, John had some issues with AEMMA and that may position AEMMA at risk if John decided not to deliver on his promise. What transpired later in the summer during the months of July and August, where John Clements became suddenly agitated with David and AEMMA, claiming copyright infringement with respect to the AEMMA online library.  John claimed that the materials on the AEMMA website was stolen from the HACA site (which was entirely untrue, as the material were sourced directly from universities and museums in Europe, and AEMMA had permission to post them but only if they were made available to a limited audience). There were numerous flaming email correspondence from John to David, in additional to threatening telephone calls from John.  He threatened to bring David and AEMMA to court and suit the Academy for copyright infringement.  John claimed that the historical manuscripts were the property of HACA and that we were not permitted to have similar material on the AEMMA website. During one of the rather tense telephone calls between John and David, John forcing the issue of a law suit against AEMMA, David had reminded John that AEMMA existed in Canada, and that should he wish to pursue copyright infringement, he'd have to engage international law and international lawyers to handle the case. John appeared unaware that Canada was a separate country from the United States! John later called back and resigned himself from the WMAW, claiming that he \"hated\" all things Canadian and wished the demise to AEMMA as a result of the negative impact his dropping out of the WMAW would have on the event.";

There was no one else immediately available who would've had as much \"pull\" as John Clements in order to save the event on such short notice.  Finances were threatened, and David was going through dark days trying to save the event. Sometime, mid-August, David received an incredible phone call from Maestro Ramon Martinez. He claimed that he heard of the pullout by John Clements, and conveyed that he, Jeanette Acosta-Martinez, Paul Macdonald and Andrea Lupo Sinclair had had a number of discussions about the event, and all decided that they would help me out by coming to the workshop and delivering classes, seminars and training given it was no longer an \"HACA\" event. It was as if that summer, the split between the \"dark side\" (the HACA camp) and the rest of the historical martial arts community materialized and remained in place for years to come. It was also an overwhelming feeling of relief to David and AEMMA that the WMAW 2000 was saved becoming one of the most memorable events in AEMMA's history.</p><p>The year was also very busy for AEMMA as its training program continued to evolve and stabilize, and AEMMA became quite visible in the media with events and presentations which include: Guelph School of Japanese Sword Arts, Welland Centre Medieval Presentation, Ontario Model Soldier Society Medieval Presentation in Etobicoke, Champoinship Jousting Tournament in Guelph, and appearances in various media such as the magazine \"Histoire M&eacute;di&eacute;vale\", France, a news article in the Press Herald, Portland, Maine, Global TV news cast on the WMAW, an article in the Toronto Star entitled \"<a href=\"../images/toronto_star_2000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Once a Knight\"><i>Once a Knight</i></a>\", the National Post with \"<a href=\"../images/nationalPost_2000.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Serious Swordplay\"><i>Serious Swordplay</i></a>\", August 12, 2000, and the Welland Tribune with an article entitled \"<a href=\"../images/tribune_2000.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Medieval artists live by the sword\"><i>Medieval artists live by the sword</i></a>\".

AEMMA became an officially registered not-for-profit corporation on May 28, 2001. <a href=\"#9\" title=\"reference: corporate letters patent\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> This was an important step, as it laid the platform for the acquisition of insurance which was required should AEMMA deliver presentations and acquire a rental space for training.

It was a long term project, with beginnings in 1999 and captured a \"freeze frame\" of what AEMMA was doing at that time. It was a challenging project as techniques and AEMMA's understanding evolved rapidly, and the orientation quickly moved from the German swordplay, predominantly based on Talhoffer, back to Fiore dei Liberi's works. By the time the book was released, the training program at AEMMA had already move on to focus entirely on the works of Fiore, however, it was felt that the material still had relevance to historical martial arts practitioners across the planet. AEMMA published it online on their website whereby anyone could download the PDF file. To the surprise of David and AEMMA, over the course of two years, there were more than 14,000 recorded downloads!

$history_p12[0] = "AEMMA also had begun a long-time relationship with the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) with a presentation entitled \"<i>How a Man Shall be Armed in the 14th Century</i>\". This popular program was first delivered on December 30 and 31st. Having been so popular with the visitors at the ROM, it was delivered again on January 6-7, 2001, April 14th, September 8th in the same year.  More presentations were made in 2002 and onwards. An amusing anecdote on the first presentation, after David was all armed up, AEMMA proceeded to demonstrate some armoured combat. The gallery was filled with people, and hundreds of children were sitting on the floor around the perimeter of the cleared area for the presentation. During the demonstration, David, using a perfectly executed <i>posta longa</i> tossed Brian to the floor onto his back, and slid across the floor for a few metres, stopping at the perimeter with his head (in a helmet) landing on a child's lap. There was a moment of astounded silence, and then everyone cheered with the spectacular presentation, including the children around Brian's final destination!</p><p>Another memorable presentation was AEMMA's first armoured judicial duel, delivered on a very hot and sunny day in Orangeville, Ontario, July 13-15th, 2001 as part of the World Championship Jousting Tournament. \"The Duel\" as its come to be known as, was a duel between David and his brother, Anton. The video of the duel was filmed and produced by Peter Yu. Aside from a number of armoured officials and combatants approaching the lists imitating Monty Pythons' knights and coconut shells, the demonstration was viewed by at least 300 people. Dave Murphy, Brian and John Woods were the officiating and marshaling the duel. During the duel, David managed to disarm Anton, who then resorted to dagger.  David struck Anton with the longsword, which Anton was able to grab and struck David on the visor with a powerful dagger strike. From all perspectives, it appeared that the dagger had penetrated the visor and into David's face.  For a moment, David was stunned and just stood there motionless, while Brian and Murph were wondering if this was the end for David. Anton quickly lifted his visor to check on his brother's well being. But David burst into action again, and took Anton down to the ground winning the duel. It became apparent after the duel that after Anton struck David with the dagger, and there was a moment of concern, Anton's only thought was that mom was going to be pissed if he injured or killed David!";

$history_p13[0] = "AEMMA held its classes initially at the John Innes Community Recreation Centre, and later, AEMMA move to a location in Regent Park at the Regent Park Community Centre. The Academy had perhaps 10-12 members and seemed to have reached a maximum while using the community centre locations. However, work was underway to search for a new location of which AEMMA would have more control over. In 2002, the Academy eventually found a new location located at 877 St. Clair West, approximately 6 blocks west of Christie. It was located on the second floor of a Dollar Club, owned by a fellow by the name of Sid Jagga, and which happened to have been a \"Speak Easy\" during the prohibition era in Canada.  Interestingly, AEMMA was the only martial arts school that had its own bar, as the bar remained intact at the new \"salle d'armes\". Interestingly, everyone had to walk through the Dollar Club store to reach the stairs which lead up to the top floor of the building. 2002 was also the year that AEMMA along with two other principles or as they were referred to as \"Member Organizations\" (Shawn Zirger, JKD and Ryan Kennedy, Toronto Wing Chun), formed the Fighting Arts Co-operative of Toronto, or FACT. The lease for St. Clair was signed by the new FACT corporation. Later that same year, AEMMA made its largest ever purchase of weapons (longswords), from Valentine Armories in Calgary, AB.  Twenty-seven (27) aluminum longswords were purchased in a single order, five for Guelph, one to Jeffrey C. Larson (USA) and the rest to students in Toronto. David Murphy was AEMMA's first Free Scholar, who went through the paces of AEMMA's first Free Scholar test athte St.Clair <i>sall d'armes</i> on April 13, 2003. This was followed shortly after by <a href=\"javascript:popup('../content/bios','ftwilliams.php',550,450)\" title=\"Frank T. Williams\">Frank T. Williams</a> in 2005 at the new location of Dupont and Ossington, where AEMMA and FACT currently reside. Frank joined AEMMA in late 2001 and eventually became a member of the executive, and was also the first instructor of sword instruction program at the ROM. AEMMA's first multiple challenge Scholar test was conducted at the Regent Park facility on May 27, 2001. The students who challenged for the test were Chris Armstrong who started training on Novembe 27, 2000 and Phil Groff, who started training on July 15, 2000. They both were successful in their challenges and became AEMMA's second and third students to hold a formal rank of Scholar. This test also set the ritual of presenting the successful Scholars with rondel daggers as a symbol of their Scholar status.";

$history_p14[0] = "Another notable individual, who trained with AEMMA for a while was Lilith Muramasa.  She had a \"thing\" for David, believing him to be a Templar incarnate and that he was part of a much larger plan in the universe.  She believed this to be true as she was also a student and practitioner of numerology and this doesn't lie. Aside from her rather unorthodox beliefs, and her short time at training, she did contribute to AEMMA in July 2005, a painting of AEMMA's officially granted armorial bearings on a large canvas which measured approximately 6ft square. She also painted and donated Fiore's sette spada, measuring approximately 4ft wide by 8ft long in 2002.  The painted <i>sette spada</i> had been and continues to be an excellent teaching aid for AEMMA, and both it and the armorial bearings remain suspended on the walls at FACT at the Dupont & Ossington location. The departure from St. Clair was not without difficulties. Over the time AEMMA leased the premises, the owner of the building (Mr. Jagga) ignored numerous requests for ventilation improvements and general enhancements to the conditions of the space. Although AEMMA maintained monthly payments religiously, it was quickly realized by the executive of AEMMA and FACT, that departure was necessary, in particular in light of students potentially becoming ill due to the risk of exposure to mould in the training space.  AEMMA and FACT moved to its present location on the top floor of the building located at 927 Dupont St, just west of Ossington, Toronto.";

$history_p15[0] = "Although not directly related to the growth and evolution of AEMMA, David's passion for the art and for the Academy prompted him to take a \"pilgrimage\" to Fiore's birthplace, in the village of Premariacco located approximately 15km from the city of Cividale in the province of Udine, Italy while visiting family in Slovenia, October 2005. What makes the trip so remarkable was the opportunity to have met with the Minister of Culture by the name of Mr. Luca Tosolini. Interestingly, Fiore was no stranger in the village, and Mr. Tosolini was quite knowledgable about Fiore's past and was excited that someone from \"America\" was also interested in Fiore. The village's history with respect to Fiore is also depicted on its coat of arms, <i>Azure (blue), a sword (rapier) in bend sinistra</i>. He had personally provided a guided tour of the village to David, pointing out the house in which Fiore's family had lived (much of the house was destroyed by an earthquake, but was rebuilt), and the church that Fiore once had attended as a child and as young man. Unfortunately, there is no grave site for Fiore, as it is unknown exactly when and where he died. The day long tour and visit, along with lunch with the Minister concluded with a parting gift from Mr. Tosolini, an actual copy of Pisani Dossi MS <i>Flos Duellatorum</i>, published in 1902. This book along with a smaller book containing the history of the village made for an excellent and most memorable Fiore dei Liberi visit and strengthened David's interest and passion for the <i>l`arte dell`armizare</i>.";

$history_p16[0] = "The move to Dupont & Ossington was initially challenging as there was a drop in students enrolled. This was anticipated, but recovery took longer than expected.  FACT had remained alive for the first few years as a result of financial assistance provided by David.  Fortunately, as student numbers increased, and costs were managed, the financial dependency diminished to the point of not owing any funds, and FACT continued with a healthy financial outlook. During the years from 2001 to 2014, AEMMA was involved in numerous presentations, demonstrations, tournaments, workshops, newspaper articles, TV news, etc. Some members of the Academy also were involved in some documentaries aired on Discovery Channel and History Channel. Some were even involved in a docu-drama filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia entitled \"<i>Bannockburn: Battle of Kings</i>\", November 25 - December 4, 2013. Although, this wasn't the purpose of the Academy, it didn't hurt to make some coin on the members' new skills developed over years of hard training! The Academy, AEMMA had become a recognized institution in Toronto over the years, whereby the general public was cognizant of what AEMMA was all about.
