$privacy_p2[0] = "Our privacy philosophy is based on the concept of fair information practices. This means we provide our associates, affiliates and other relationships with notice of how we manage information so that they can have a more informed understanding of how we operate and of the usage of the information collected.";
$privacy_p3[0] = "This privacy statement is intended to inform the users about how we collect, use, share and protect their information on the AEMMA Website. We have established the following principles that govern our information practices: ";

$privacy_l3[0] = "We will implement certain programming/coding to protect email addresses entered into the AEMMA Website (such as a guestbook entry) for the purpose of reducing the probability of email addresses being harvested by spammers. This coded approach is not absolute, however, AEMMA is confident that the level of protection on email address visible on the web pages is suitable. Should newer and more effective methods be discovered, these will be incorporated into the AEMMA website.";
