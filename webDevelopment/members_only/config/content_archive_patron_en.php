$gb_p1[0] = "Robbie Sprules is a long time friend of David's.  Robbie expressed interest in the Academy and wanted to get more involved with the Academy, and therefore, he was positioned as the Patron of the Pas d'Armes for these events at the Royal Ontario Museum.  He had also donated a fairly large claymore, which hangs in the armoury, listing those individuals who were voted 'first amongst equals' at these pas d'armes.";
