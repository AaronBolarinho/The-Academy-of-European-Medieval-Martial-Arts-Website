$gb_p1[0] = "The update log archive is preserved as part of the history of the formation and development of the AEMMA's website. At the time of the web development in the early 2000's, it was relatively standard to log the archives and make those updates in the logs available on the public site. Be wary that a number of the live links on this page may no longer function, in particular, if routed to old or non-existent AEMMA web pages.";
