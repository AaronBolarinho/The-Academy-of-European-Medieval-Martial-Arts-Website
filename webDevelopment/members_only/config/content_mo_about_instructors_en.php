$instructors_3_bio[0] = "Aaron Bolarinho currently holds the rank of Free Scholar of the Academy of European Medieval Martial Arts. Aaron began his training with AEMMA at the age of seventeen at the Academy's Chapter in Guelph, Ontario under the instruction of Provost David Murphy. Aaron has had a passion for the study of medieval violence and martial arts from an early age. After several years with the Academy in Guelph, Aaron moved to Toronto to begin an undergraduate degree in Medieval History and Philosophy at the University of Toronto. He achieved the rank of Scholar of the Academy in December 2008, and graduated from U of T in the June 2012. He achieved his Free-Scholar designation at the Academy in August, 2014. In 2015, Aaron completed a Masters Degree in History from the Universities of Waterloo and Laurier, and in 2016 Aaron completed a Masters degree in Medieval Studies from the Center for Medieval Studies in Toronto, Ontario.</p><p>Since the manuscripts of Fiore dei Liberi formed the basis for his initial education, Aaron has a particular passion for the fighting art of the Flower of Battle. While his experience at AEMMA allowed him to dabble in other martial manuscripts like the Royal Armouries I.33 or the gran simulacro of Capo Ferro, Fiore has always held Aaron's heart. Since Fiore wanted his students to be all-around fighters, Aaron endeavors to supplement his training with other grappling and striking arts. Specifically, he has trained with Shawn Zirger of the Zirger Academy of Martial Arts; whose expertise and guidance continues to be a critical part of Aaron's ongoing education. Additionally, as a consequence of the research efforts of Free Scholars Beau Brock and Aldo Valente into the fencing treatise of Giovanni dall'Agocchie, Aaron has also fallen in love with the sword in one hand.</p><p>Aaron hopes that he continues to have the opportunity to train with the Academy long into the future. Beyond his own martial training, Aaron thinks that nothing is more difficult than being a good teacher. He is grateful for every teaching opportunity he receives, and always appreciates feedback on his instruction.";

Joining AEMMA, he found a group of like-minded people who also were interested in the longbow's simplicity and challenge. Currently, Paul organizes and instructs the AEMMA archery group and the Royal Ontario Museum Mediaeval Longbow course. He still takes great pleasure in experimenting with and building primitive and mediaeval archery tackle. Paul helped start two archery clubs in BC and also gave seminars showing camp instructors how to teach archery. By then, Paul was an experienced woodworker, yet he found making archery tackle still pleasantly challenging.";
