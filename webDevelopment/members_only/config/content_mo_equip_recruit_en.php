$equip_p11[0]	= "Individuals who are interested in training at the Academy are often intimiated by the potentially high capital cost of training, thinking that weapons and some form of armour is required to train. These items would be necessary if and only if the recruit decides to challenge for the scholler test and engage in advanced <i>armizare</i> training.";

$equip_l21[0]	= "It is recommended that the recruit acquire flat-soled training shoes/boots, such as wrestling or boxing shoes. Running shoe soles have a tendency to be sticky on the floor which may cause injury to knee joints when movements such as twisting on the foot are performed. Although, initially, a comfortable pair of running shoes will be fine for the first few months of training.";
$equip_l22[0]	= "New recruits are encouraged to purchase an AEMMA training t-shirt. Usually, there are shirts in stock at the salle d'armes and come in all sizes, but if not, a plain white t-shirt in the interim is recommended.";
$equip_l23[0]	= "Dark, preferably black, unmarked leggings or sweats are preferred and recommended. Summer time, shorts are permitted at the salle.";
$equip_l24[0]	= "Recruits are encouraged to purchase leather gauntlets (periodically, AEMMA organizes a multi-individual purchase of items, thereby, saving on shipping costs). However, a basic pair of leather gardening gloves will suffice for the first few months of practice.";
$equip_l25[0]	= "Weapons (sword, dagger) are not required in the first few months of training, as the salle d'armes will have extra training weapons. Recruits are encouraged to purchase their own sword if they have a desire to progress to the scholler rank in the future.  Periodically, AEMMA will organize a multi-individual purchase of weapons, which will save on shipping costs. These savings are passed along to the students in the purchases.";

$equip_p12[0]	= "In general, the initial capital investment for Recruits joining AEMMA and its training program will amount to less than <b>$100</b> (t-shirt, leather gloves/gauntlets, leggings), assuming that appropriate shoes were already in possession.";
