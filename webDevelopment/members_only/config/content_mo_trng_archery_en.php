$trng_l1[0]	= "A longbow is a type of bow that is tall—roughly equal to the height of the user; allowing the archer a fairly long draw, at least to the jaw. A longbow is not significantly recurved. Its limbs are relatively narrow so that they are circular or D-shaped in cross section. Flatbows can be just as long; the difference is that, in cross-section, a flatbow has limbs that are approximately rectangular. source: Wikipedia. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longbow\" target=\"_blank\">Longbow</a>.

$trng_l2[0]	= "The Battle of Crécy (1346), also called Battle of Cressy, was an English victory during the Edwardian phase of the Hundred Years' War. Coupled with the later battles of Poitiers (also fought during the Edwardian phase) and Agincourt, it was the first of the three major English successes during the conflict. The battle was fought on 26 August 1346 near Crécy, in northern France. An army of English, Welsh, and allied troops from the Holy Roman Empire led by Edward III of England, engaged and defeated a much larger army of French, Genoese and Majorcan troops led by Philip VI of France. Emboldened by the lessons of tactical flexibility and utilisation of terrain learned from the earlier Saxons, Vikings and the recent battles with the Scots, the English army won an important victory. source: Wikipedia. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cr%C3%A9cy\" target=\"_blank\">Battle of Crécy</a>.

Arrows were fired with a high trajectory, descending on the approaching foe at an angle. The rate of fire was up to one arrow every 5 seconds against the crossbow’s rate of a shot every two minutes; the crossbow requiring to be reloaded by means of a winch. For close quarter fighting the archers used hammers or daggers to batter at an adversary’s armour or penetrate between the plates. source: British Battles. <a href=\"http://www.britishbattles.com/one-hundred-years-war/battle-of-crecy/\" target=\"_blank\">Battle of Crécy</a>.
