During the Late Middle Ages, the longsword had a position of honour among these disciplines, and sometimes historical European swordsmanship (HES) is used to refer to swordsmanship techniques specifically. source: Wikipedia. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_European_martial_arts\" target=\"_blank\">Historical European martial arts</a>.
