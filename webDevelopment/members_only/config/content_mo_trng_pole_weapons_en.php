Also known by the names poll-axe, pole axe, polax, or Hache (French meaning axe), the standard spelling \"pollaxe\" is most common. <sup><a href=\"#1\" title=\"Reference #1: pollaxe\">[1]</a></sup> The pollaxe design arose from the need to breach the plate armor of men at arms during the 14th and 15th centuries. Generally, the form consisted of a wooden haft some 4-6.5 feet (1.2-2 m) long, mounted with a steel head. It seems most schools of combat suggested a haft length comparable to the height of the wielder, but in some cases hafts appear to have been create up to 8 feet (2.5 m) in length. ";

Pollaxes are a class of weapons that can be catergorized as \"polearms\" or \"staff weapons\", and therefore, in combination with pollaxe training, AEMMA also covers spear training as well. The pollaxe weapons employed for training include 3 variations, one variety are pollaxes constructed with steel heads with sharpened spikes. These are historical reproductions and are only used for structured training drills. The second type are die-cast dense rubber heads These are found to be quite useful and viable for both training and tournament purposes. The third form of pollaxes are constructed with aluminum heads.

The text consists of a prologue (fols. 2r-v, paragraphs 1-4), a main section (paragraphs 4-51) describing combat between two right-handed opponents, followed by a shorter part (paragraphs 52-73) discussing how a right-handed knight should deal with a left-handed opponent.

$trng_l4[0]	= "A spear is a pole weapon consisting of a shaft, usually of wood, with a pointed head. The head may be simply the sharpened end of the shaft itself, as is the case with fire hardened spears, or it may be made of a more durable material fastened to the shaft, such as flint, obsidian, iron, steel or bronze. The most common design for hunting or combat spears since ancient times has incorporated a metal spearhead shaped like a triangle, lozenge, or leaf. The heads of fishing spears usually feature barbs or serrated edges. source: Wikipedia. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear\" target=\"_blank\">Spear</a>. Retrieved: January 17, 2017.";
