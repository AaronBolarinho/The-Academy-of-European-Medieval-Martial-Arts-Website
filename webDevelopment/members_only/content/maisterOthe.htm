<font style="color: red;">The Maisters Othe is an extract from the book entitled "English Martial Arts" written by Terry Brown.  The othe was based upon the procedures of an organisation that is known to have governed English martial arts during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. His book is available and can be found on this site under Virtual Market Place => Books => Contemporary.  AEMMA does not incorporate these oaths into the ranking system currently being constructed, however, it is available simply from a historical reference perspective.</font><br />&nbsp;
