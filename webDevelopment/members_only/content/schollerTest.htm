<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
A <b>scholler</b> is a student of the medieval fighting arts known as <i><b>l`arte dell`armizare</b></i> or simply as <b><i>armizare</i></b> and who has committed to learning and training in the art from an academic/intellectual perspective and physical/technical perspective. The <b>scholler</b> recognizes that this is a life-time commitment and a life-style choice in order to achieve the level of excellence that will enrich his/her life on many levels, including self-defense skills, self-confidence and physical health. The <b>scholler</b> must abide by the rules and constitutions of the Academy, and be prepared to obtain the relevant historically accurate arms & armour for that those weapons type for their respective skills and weapons orientation. The <b>scholler</b> must also be willing and able to assist in the growth and development of the Academy by imparting their current skill and expertise to recruits on request by the intructors.

<p><b>The Procedure</b></p>
<p>The challenger (<b>recruit</b>) will make his/her claim for the prize of <b>scholler</b> rank by initially making their claim to the AEMMA exec.  Should the AEMMA exec determine that the candidate is ready and prepared to test, and an agreement is reached on a target test date, the challenger will then communicate to the Academy (using the Academy's internal elist) their desire to challenge for the prize of <b>scholler</b> and the proposed date of the test.  The test will then be scheduled during the latter portion of a regular practice arranged by the AEMMA exec.  The test will be conducted in the presence of the membership and students, and the candidate's invited guests should he/she choose to do so.  The <b>scholler</b> test is available to everyone at AEMMA provided the requirements are met (see requirements described in the scholler page online).  Requests can be submitted to challenge for the <b>scholler</b> prize anytime, including the day of the scheduled <b>scholler</b> test, however, those submitted on that day will be scheduled at an agreed to date sometime after the current <b>scholler</b> test.</p>
