apache server location:

cd /var/www/html

making a new working directory:

in /var/www/html

sudo ln -s location desiredName

So in this case

sudo ln -s /home/aaron/aemma/webDevelopment/ AEMMA

Then /var/www/html shows:

AEMMA  index.html  info.php  phpinfo.php

And AEMMA in this case is BLUE. If it is not blue, but RED, the link is broken (likely because link location does not exist)

There may be a benefit to discussing the mind frame that teaching should be approached with. Ie. I suffer from a lot of imposter syndrome when it comes to teaching class, particularly when my students have wanted to press into more advanced item and I’m unsure of how to balance keeping their interest with their need to get good at the drills with the fact that not all plays come as easily to me.

o In general the mindset of a teacher presents its own challenge. It keep things interesting as you are figuring out how to respond and where to find authority as not being a free scholar you aren’t really cleared to teach but face an opportunity to do so

• Suggested additional Drill: Aldo’s footwork drill. This is a funny one in that at least this school that I’ve been at has zero conception of footwork, and while one would hope you’d get it from grappling the triangle drill where you start with the footwork of step off the line, move your second foot, then do the revereso cover and then reset helps with the sliver students need for dagger (And even with grappling at AEMMA helped me a lot with how to move within the dagger covers)

• I really like the quotes throughout the material. Students seem to perk up a bit if Fiore said it so it’s very helpful to have a few specifics of what he said (that said I should also do more of my own reading but…when time is tight I think this will help mightily)

• 4th remedy master cover  (page 9) an emphasis of nestling the hands to avoid thumb injury may be a good idea

• Within the listing of the covers I think it would be helpful to explicitly call out what attack they respond to in the titles ex. Fendente Attack – 4th Remedy Master Cover. I think the knowledge of the plays by their master and number deepens post making scholar but for me given when I moved that’s shakier than perhaps it should be, but I would imagine this would be the case for other similarly new or short on training post making scholar individuals.

• 3rd Remedy Master Cover: I would switch the order of points 2 and 1 as to emphasize it’s a two handed cover, vs starting with the landing point for the right hand

• With the landing points, contextually it is talking about landing on the attacker but it might be clearer if that was called out as part of the point ie “The landing point for the cover is the lower half of the attacker’s right hand palm knife edge or slightly lower on the wrist” (3rd remedy master point 1)

•  3rd remedy master point 5  struggling with this one a little, in terms of understanding, perhaps add that the position should be similar to frontale again within this point?

• Traps: I have heard different theories as to whether we should train to trap when making covers or not. Is the current view you should always trap but trap lightly so that you can respond?

• 9th Remedy Master point 1: again I’d emphasize nestling tightly as to not injure a thumb

• 9th remedy master: perhaps a warning about not pumping but going straight out to the cover?

• I would suggest adding the footwork for each cover, but I am at a place where footwork is a big struggle for my students so that may be subjective

• Footwork: 1st Remedy master cover: in terms of bringing the back foot with them, this is one of the places in the art where it seem to me the feet end up in line rather than at the usual shoulder distance (once you’ve brought it back) as to leave the line open if the dagger does push through. Is this accurate?

• Footwork general comments: perhaps add one on true time. My student struggle to learn to kill with the foot and this school goes foot body hand so it’s a hard concept for them

• I really like the addition of the attacker changing their orientation to the Drill – Around the Clock

• Page 17, Drill “you only get one” – how do to it, point 2 sentence 2, should be “When the defender makes their defense” rather than make their defense

• The last page I am particularly glad to have, thank you for including it here. In terms of pulling together a lesson plan I wish I’d been leveraging it all along.


Hey,

So I think this would have been very helpful indeed to have when I was starting and I'd love to have it for the other two. It would have helped me come up with lesson plans and structure the material and would have helped keep the classes more varied which turns into a retention challenge.

I think it also helps with adding legitimacy to what one is doing teaching AEMMA while not at AEMMA and provides a good sanity check

In terms of format...If I could have the sun the moon and the stars I'd love to have a video per play that I could watch from different angles to remember the play and how it fits together. I've got a pet project I keep putting off to write up all my notes from the camping weekend and have a play per slide in a powerpoint so I can have them almost as flash cards. I've been adding the names we use for the plays in the Salle as a way to try to help jogging my memory

If we really wanted to talk having the universe it'd be great to have a mailing list for traveling scholars, that way a) we would hear about events far enough in advance to book tickets (I'll be in toronto trice this May so i can make the scholar presentation day) and b) so that we can maybe pair up? I've been terrible about practicing my postas at home even though I have my sword int eh closet.  I think I should have tried to find myself a partner when I moved away because it's really easy to fall of the wagon, having someone else to check in with to say, did you practice cuts or postas today might be good

Teaching

  I, the aforementioned Fiore, have seen a thousand men calling themselves masters, though not four among them were good students, and of those four none would be a good teacher. - PD Carta 2.A.a

  I, Maestro Fiore, was very happy teaching these and many other students, since I was well paid and received the honor and the love of them and their families. - F.1.r.b

  Upon request I will offer some thoughts about teaching in the following section. I am actually quite reticent to do this; not least because I consider myself very new to the study of teaching...and very novice as a consequence. Nevertheless, I will attempt to share some thoughts and be as useful as I can.
    As a preface, I will start by saying that I - like many - have been privilaged to be taught by a great many teachers on a great many subjects. Each and every teacher that has ever taught me has had their own style, their flavor, and used their own strategies to facilitiate my education. I am of the view that teaching is an incredibly personal and intimate activity, and each and every teacher (and the methods they bring with them) has their own individual strengths and weaknesses.
      It follows then that those who wish to learn how to teach recognise that there is no one way, one method, or one set of teaching skills without which one cannot teach. Nevertheless, it also follows that each teacher ought to be very honest with themselves about their strengths and weaknesses. That done, a teacher ought to constantly utilize their strengths and improve their weaknesses so as to give the best product to their students.
        In the case where you are lucky enough to be one teacher amongst many, the faculty will be able to organise its curriculum where each teacher gets to spend most of their time teaching the subjects in which they are most expert. If you are a lone, traveling scholar - or indeed a Free Scholar who is starting their own school - your teaching responsibility is total; all nessesary subjects must be covered, regardless of how confident you are with the subjects.
          In that case, there is no option but to do it and utilize every advantage and resource you can. Regardless of the quality of the final product, I think its important to remember this: if you have tried your best, and you are activly engaged in learning to be a better teacher, you should be proud of yourself the students will be grateful.
            To assist you in your efforts I will offer some comments on three subjects: teaching mindset, teaching techniques, and lesson plans. I shall offer what has either worked for me personally or what I have seen work well at AEMMA. I will emphasise that these things are merely suggetions and if you use them you will no doubt modfiy them according to your own personality, expertise, teaching goals, and the natures of your students.
              Like armizare, teaching is a lifelong craft to learn...and no one should expect to achieve expertise in either thing very quickly. Take a long term view on your training as a teacher, and keep at it. With enough time and practice you will become as great a teacher as you are a student of the Art. Good Luck.
