apache server location:

cd /var/www/html

making a new working directory:

in /var/www/html

sudo ln -s location desiredName

So in this case

sudo ln -s /home/aaron/aemma/webDevelopment/ AEMMA

Then /var/www/html shows:

AEMMA  index.html  info.php  phpinfo.php

And AEMMA in this case is BLUE. If it is not blue, but RED, the link is broken (likely because link location does not exist)

- Also note, to run everything you have to npm start in my-app, and also enter node server.js to start the express server.
